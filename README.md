# STBoyden's Zed Config

Standardised config files for Zed.

## Updating

> [!NOTE]
> Updates are script-based, at least until Zed implements its own settings sync
> system.

In the `scripts` directory, there are three scripts for checking the update
status of this repository, and to update to and from accordingly. Included, also
is a Zed `tasks.json` file that contains global tasks that can be ran to update
the Zed config from inside the editor itself, using the scripts.
